# Animated Dashboard UI (Vanilla JS)

A simple front-end animation project built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The app animates UI elements sequentially on page load, creating a clean dashboard-style reveal.

## ✨ Features

- Fade & slide-in header animation
- Rotating loading spinner effect
- Delayed main content reveal
- Animated vertical progress bars with different fill levels
- No libraries or frameworks (pure JS)

## 🧠 How It Works

On `window.load`, the script:
1. Reveals the header and app container
2. Rotates the spinner for a visual loading effect
3. Fades in the main content after a short delay
4. Animates multiple vertical bars by changing their heights dynamically

All animations are controlled using JavaScript with timed delays (`setTimeout`) and CSS transitions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (transitions & transforms)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation & timing)
